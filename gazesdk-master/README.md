# gazesdk #

Python language bindings implemented in Cython for Tobii GazeSDK C API. 

This is a work in progress. Backwards incompatible changes are possible in the near future. Currently only basic tracking functionality is supported, See TODO below for planned changes.

Note that use of this software is not officially supported by Tobii.

## Example ##

The following example prints normalized screen coordinates for first 20 events.

```python
from gazesdk import *

url = get_connected_eye_tracker()
t = Tracker(url)
t.run_event_loop()

t.connect()
t.start_tracking()

for _ in range(20):
    data = t.event_queue.get()
    print (data.left.gaze_point_on_display_normalized, 
    	   data.right.gaze_point_on_display_normalized)
    t.event_queue.task_done()

t.stop_tracking()
t.disconnect()

t.break_event_loop()
```

## Installation (Windows) ##

Dependencies: Python 2.7 32 bit
